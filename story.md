## Inspiration
I wanted to build a platform that would help people with the sport of basketball. I for once, have barely any idea about the sport and whenever I see highlights I am amazed by the way the shots are taken. So, my primary objective was to create an app that would help people see what shot or what type of play was made. So, I made a project for just the same reason.

## What it does
It does a few things. Once you are in the app you have three screens. One is the main search screen wherein you can search with either Images or text. You could query using either Image and you will receive a textual description of what is the image. You can also get to use text, to get back the image back which you want to see. There are also two chatbots. One is Jina AI-based and one is the DiagFlow based both of them are trained to answer basketball-related questions. 

## How I built it
I used Jina AI, for the chatbot and the search application. I used Flask to make the server and I used Flutter for the frontend. I also used another Flask server to handle the webhooks for the DiagFlow, to handle the custom Intent I made. 

## Challenges I ran into
Using Jina AI is always a challenge. It took me a long time just to understand what is happening and how to make it happen. It took me a long time to figure out the right endpoints for Flutter to actually make it work. It also took me a long time to link two different Jina projects into one and make them work. It is also an issue just to make everything work correctly. Using selenium to scrape the right data is always a problem. 

## Accomplishments that I am proud of
Oh, I am really proud of this project. At the starting of the project, I was perusing through the examples available on the Jina repository. I tried recreating the same but there was an issue. I tried everything to fix it and turns out with some help I was able to and I created my first PR on the project and then I was able to fix it for anyone who will ever try to use the example. I am very proud of the fact. Not only just that I was able to do something I have never been able to do, but that was also to use Jina on a front end other than CLI. It was so good to see in the end that finally it worked.



## What I learned
I learned a lot about everything. My understanding of Jina came to another level and I learned a lot about Flutter, flask, and python too.
